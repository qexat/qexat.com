        hi, I'm qexat. there are many other names that I used to be called with.
        please use this one. before I start, I'm perfectly alive and I intend to
        be ; stating this because I know what this text will look like at first
        glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        anyway. honestly, this stuff called the Internet fucked me up. I... want
        to heal. I want to grow up too. I'm tired of these, uh,
        <em>thoughts</em>. if we used to be friends but lost contact because I
        deleted most of my accounts and shit: firstly, I'm sorry ; secondly,
        thank you a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        it is not easy for me either. my eyes are humid as I'm writing this. I
        want things to get better. unfortunately, things don't magically
        improve. if you want them to, you have to act upon it. that's what I
        want to try to do. I hope you will understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that we are the sum of our experiences and the product of our
        environment. therapy is one thing, which I want to do, but the truth is
        that if the world around me doesn't shift, I won't change much either.
        in the end, we're still humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        in case you're wondering about what happened, I don't know. it's
        something I've been pondering on for quite a while already. I've just
        never cut off of everything because honestly, all of this is scary.
        leaving my comfort zone, some of my friends too. yeah, I'm really sorry
        about that.
      </p>
      <p>
        if you're dealing with mental health issues as well, you deserve to feel
        better. you deserve to get helped. I know it. we will get through this
        together, okay?
